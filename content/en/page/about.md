# 👋 About Me

Welcome to my blog! I'm a university student majoring in computer science, 
deeply passionate about the world of computer science. Here's a little about me 
and what I do:

## 🎓 Education

**University Student**  
Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in computer science at the university of Rouen. 
My academic journey is centered around exploring the depths of computer science 
and its myriad applications.

## 👨‍🎓 Tutoring and Knowledge Sharing

I am deeply passionate about sharing knowledge and teaching others. To this end, 
I regularly conduct tutoring sessions for my peers and juniors in various 
computer science subjects. These sessions not only allow me to share my 
understanding but also to strengthen my own grasp of the material.

Creating comprehensive and easy-to-understand materials is a significant part of 
my tutoring. I utilize LaTeX extensively for producing formal documents 
that aid in learning. My aim is not just to help others pass their exams, but to
make them understande the biutilifullness of this domaine.

## 🗂️ Research Interests

- **Formal Algorithm Validation:** I am fascinated by the intricacies of 
ensuring that algorithms perform as intended, adhering to strict standards of 
correctness and efficiency. As well as develloping formal methode to make 
software.
- **Functional Programming:** The elegance and robustness of functional 
programming languages captivate me.
- **Language Theory:** The theoretical underpinnings of programming languages, 
including their syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, are a key area of interest 
for me.

## 💻 Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** 
  - C: Constantly leaning the new about the langague that introduice me to this 
  pasione.
  - Java: Experienced in building object-oriented applications. With formal 
  definition, like MVC.
  - PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS: Got the basic skilled in web development. From 
  front side to server-side. 
  - OCaml: The language that introduice me to the fantastique functional 
  paradigm.
  - Haskell: Currently learning this fantastique langauge as well as the 
  matematical theory behind it. 
  - Python: Experienced in Python for various applications, from application 
  development to small data analysis.

## 📧 Connect with Me
